# WEEK 2: Count-and-Say Sequence 

## Overview

This C# program generates the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. The sequence starts with "1" and each subsequent term is generated by describing the digits of the previous term.

## How It Works

### Sequence Explanation

- **1** is read as "one 1" → **11**
- **11** is read as "two 1s" → **21**
- **21** is read as "one 2, one 1" → **1211**
- **1211** is read as "one 1, one 2, two 1s" → **111221**

### Program Functions

1. **Main Method**
    - Prompts the user to enter a value `n`.
    - Calls `GenerateNthTerm(n)` to compute the nth term.
    - Prints the result.

2. **GenerateNthTerm Method**
    - Starts with the initial term "1".
    - Iteratively generates the next term `n - 1` times using `GetNextTerm`.
    - Returns the nth term.

3. **GetNextTerm Method**
    - Takes a term and generates the next term in the sequence.
    - Counts consecutive characters in the current term and describes them.
    - Constructs and returns the next term.

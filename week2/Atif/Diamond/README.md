This C# program prints a diamond shape made of asterisks (*) to the console. The size of the diamond is determined by the variable n, which is set to 4 in this case. Here's a step-by-step summary of what the code does:

Initialize n: The variable n is set to 4, which represents the number of rows in the top half of the diamond.

Top Half of the Diamond:

The first for loop runs from 1 to n (inclusive), creating the top half of the diamond.
For each row i:
It prints spaces to center the asterisks.
It prints 2 * i - 1 asterisks.
This creates an increasing pattern of asterisks.
Bottom Half of the Diamond:

The second for loop runs from n-1 down to 1, creating the bottom half of the diamond.
For each row i:
It prints spaces to center the asterisks.
It prints 2 * i - 1 asterisks.
This creates a decreasing pattern of asterisks.

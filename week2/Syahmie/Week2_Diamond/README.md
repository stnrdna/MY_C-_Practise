Overview
DiamondShape is a simple C# console application that generates and prints a diamond shape based on the input number. Here's a brief summary of how the code works:

Summary
1. User Input: The program starts by prompting the user to enter a number, which determines the size of the diamond.
2. Diamond Shape Calculation: The application calculates the diamond shape by constructing the top and bottom halves separately.
3. Top Half Construction: For the top half of the diamond, the program iterates from 1 to the input number. In each iteration, it prints spaces to align the stars correctly, followed by a series of stars that form the increasing width of the diamond.
4. Bottom Half Construction: For the bottom half, the program iterates from the input number minus one down to 1. In each iteration, it prints spaces to align the stars, followed by a series of stars that form the decreasing width of the diamond.
5. Output: The final output is displayed in the console, forming a symmetrical diamond shape based on the user's input.

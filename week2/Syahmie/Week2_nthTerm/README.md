Overview
The count-and-say sequence is a series of integers where each term is generated by describing the digits of the previous term. The sequence begins with "1" and each subsequent term is formed by reading the digits of the previous term, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

How It Works
1. Initial Term: The sequence starts with "1".
2. Reading the Term: For each term, read the digits from left to right.
3. Count and Say: Count the number of times each digit appears consecutively and then write down the count followed by the digit.
4. Forming the Next Term: The next term is formed based on the counts and digits from the previous term.

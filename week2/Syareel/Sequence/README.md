This C# program generates the "Count and Say" sequence up to a specified number of terms.

The "Count and Say" sequence is a sequence of integers where each term is generated by describing the previous term. For example, starting with "1":
- The 1st term is "1".
- The 2nd term is "11" (one 1).
- The 3rd term is "21" (two 1s).
- The 4th term is "1211" (one 2, then one 1).
- The 5th term is "111221" (one 1, then one 2, then two 1s).
